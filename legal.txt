While you may make fan OSes and modify Xenon OS, there are some rulesâ€”simple rules at that. Breaking these will get your copy, modification, or fan OS taken down.

1: You'll need to give credit and state whether or not it is a modification or a fan OS.
  1.1: If it is a fan OS or a modification, there needs to be a reasonable change.
2: Provide credit to the makers of textures, music, etc in your modification or fan OS.
3: Please do not over-advertise your fan OS.
4. No changing the legal.txt, aka this file, either through inspect element or anything else. No changing the one in the OS either. You may suggest things to add to legal.txt though.

More info on Xenon OS Mods or Fan OSes:

1. You may become an "Official Fan OS Maker", and your ideas are unique, and may inspire me to add them to Xenon OS, and you have a Fan OS!
2. You may become an "Official Design Maker", your ideas are incredible, and are likely to get added, but you may not have a Fan OS.
3. You may also add new content in Xenon OS to your Mod or Fan OS.
