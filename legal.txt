While you may make fan OSes and modify Xenon OS, there are some rulesâ€”simple rules at that.

1: You'll need to give credit and state whether or not it is a modification or a fan OS.
  1.1: If it is a fan OS or a modification, there needs to be a reasonable change.
2: Provide credit to the makers of textures, music, etc in your modification or fan OS.
3: Please do not over-advertise your fan OS.
4. No changing the legal.txt, aka this file. No changing the one in the OS either. You may suggest things to add to legal.txt though.

Breaking these will get your copy, modification, or fan OS taken down.
