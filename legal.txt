While you may copy and modify Xenon OS, there are some rulesâ€”simple rules at that.

1: You'll need to give credit and state whether or not it is a modification, copy, or a fan OS.
  1.1: If it is a fan OS or a modification, there needs to be a reasonable change.
2: Provide credit to the makers of textures, music, etc in your modification, copy, or fan OS.

Breaking these will get your copy, modification, or fan OS taken down.
